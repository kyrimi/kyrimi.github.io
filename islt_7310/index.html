        <p>Hi! I’m Rio Sloan, and welcome to my website. Here you can read about my journey of emigrating from the Philippines, my job hunting experience, and my work experiences for the past 10 years.<br />
        I think personality gets lost in the formalities of displaying skill sets and work experiences and showcasing one’s resume, and what I aim with this website is that I can not only show my experiences and skills that I have collected over the past years, but also let you learn more about me as a person. <br />
        </p>
