        <h2>A look back and a look beyond</h2>
            <p id="ref_firstpar">I immigrated to the United States back in 2013, and I soon realized that it was a very different experience from what I was used to in my home country. I was afraid that I wouldn’t be able to find an opportunity with the skill set I have. A non-profit organization called Upwardly Global that helps immigrants restart their careers provided me guidance in learning resume crafting, job interviewing, and be confident in what I have. I started working here in the U.S. in 2014 and each job has been a great learning opportunity and career growth.</p>
            <p id="ref_secondpar">My career path is not so much me knowing what I wanted to do right out of college, but rather it was a journey of discovery and realizing that I like working with learning tools and helping faculty and students achieve their best when it comes to teaching and learning. That’s what the past 10 years have been for me. The more I learned about educational technology, the more I enjoyed it.</p>
            <p id="ref_thirdpar">I became interested in learning more and I came to know about the University of the Philippines Open University’s Distance Education certificate and program. My degree in Mass Communication and the skills I learned helped me get my foot in the door of the instructional technology field. I wanted to formally learn more and having a graduate coursework background seemed like a good step forward. After getting the graduate certificate, I then wanted to be in a program that focuses on managing and administering technologies for schools and institutions. And being a current employee of the University of Missouri System, I knew of the master’s degree program for Learning Technologies and Design. I enrolled and I am excited to complete this academic milestone.</p>
            <p id="ref_fourthpar">Career wise, I am happy where I currently work. The opportunity to learn and manage tools for the University of Missouri and the Canvas learning platform is something I enjoy. I’m glad that all my previous work experiences have helped me hone my skills and get to where I am now.</p>
