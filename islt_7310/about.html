        <h2>Instructional technologist and application administrator specialist</h2>
        <p>I love working with <em>instructional technology</em> and <em>working in higher education for the past 10 years</em>. My academic background includes a mass communication degree and a graduate certificate in distance education. In my current role, I oversee Canvas and other learning apps as an administrator. <br />
        <br />Beyond work, life's bustling with an energetic 6-year-old, an adorable 8-month-old, a silly husband, and lovable furry companions Loki and Kumi. Things I like to do during my free time include anime, epic Dungeons and Dragons quests, kitchen adventures, and spending time with family. Recently, I've taken up the Pokemon trading card game. Thanks to the starter decks my husband got us, it is now a new family favorite.<br />
       <br /> My life so far has been all about continuous learning, embracing parenting challenges, and finding comfort in hobbies. From professional growth to personal passions, each element enriches my life story, which I wholeheartedly embrace.</p>

                <p>In this position, I was able to focus more on the instructional technology side, and it helped me further hone my skills on system administration and managing learning applications. My position then became part of the Missouri Online department, where our team provides consultation, training, and helpdesk assistance to all the faculty members of the four University of Missouri campuses.</p>

                <p>After the T4E grant project, I was fortunate that the position was adopted to be a full-time position under the Online Education Services department.

This was my first real job after graduating and it was a great time to learn and be able to directly work with my then professor, who was the communication manager for the DALTA Group of Companies.
